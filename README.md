Overview

The files work together to provision infrastructure, manage its state, and automate interactions with PostgreSQL databases and APIs:

main.tf: A Terraform configuration file for provisioning cloud resources.

sql.sh: A Bash script for database initialization and API data management.

terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup: Terraform state files to track and manage the infrastructure.

Workflow Summary

Use main.tf to provision infrastructure, including a PostgreSQL database.

Use terraform.tfstate to verify the current state of the resources.

Run sql.sh to initialize the database schema and process API data.

1. main.tf

The main.tf file contains Terraform configuration code to provision cloud resources. It works as follows:

Key Components:

Provider Setup: Specifies the cloud provider and its credentials.

Resource Definitions: Likely includes resources such as RDS instances or networking components.

Variables and Outputs: Parameters and outputs for reusable and accessible configurations.

Usage:

Initialize Terraform: terraform init

Plan and Apply Changes: terraform plan && terraform apply

Track state in terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup.

2. sql.sh

The sql.sh script automates interactions with PostgreSQL and APIs. Its functionality includes:

Key Operations:

AWS Secrets Manager: Fetches database credentials securely.

Database Initialization: Creates necessary PostgreSQL tables (api_data, historical_data).

API Processing: Fetches and stores API data, updating and tracking changes.

Execution Flow:

Retrieves database credentials.

Initializes the database schema.

Processes APIs to update data in the database.

Dependencies:

Tools: bash, curl, jq, AWS CLI, and PostgreSQL client (psql).

Environment Setup: Requires AWS access and PostgreSQL connection details.

3. terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup

State files that track Terraform-managed resources.

Key Details:

Primary State File: terraform.tfstate contains live infrastructure state.

Backup: terraform.tfstate.backup is the last known good state before changes.

Notes:

Sensitive: Avoid manual edits or committing to version control.

Secure with access controls and consider remote backends for state management.

File Interactions

Provisioning with main.tf:

Creates infrastructure like a PostgreSQL database used by sql.sh.

State Tracking:

terraform.tfstate reflects changes from main.tf.

Database and API Automation with sql.sh:

Uses the database provisioned in main.tf to manage API data and updates.

Workflow:

Provision infrastructure using main.tf.

Confirm resource creation using terraform.tfstate.

Run sql.sh to initialize and populate the database.
